Ayttm - how does chat work
==========================

Ayttm allows you to chat with people on AIM, MSN, and other chat services
within a single interface. However it isn't magic and can't let you speak
with people on MSN via AIM, for example.

For each service you want to use, you have to define an account:
	LocalAccount: {login,password,service_type}
You can define as many (or almost ?) local accounts as you want. As some
plugins are not very reentrant for now, you should not define more than one 
local account for the same service.

For each person you want to chat with, you need at least a contact 
and an account:
	Account {login, service_type}
	Contact {name, list of accounts}
	
To be able to chat with a contact, you only have a local account which type
matches any of the contact's accounts.

Chatrooms work the same way: you'll be able to create or join any chatroom
on a service for which you have a local account. You'll be able to chat with
any of you contacts having a corresponding account. You won't be able to
invite your AIM friends on a MSN chatroom.
