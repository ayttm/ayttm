Here's a quick overview of the nomenclature used in EveryBuddy.  


ACCOUNT
  An ACCOUNT has two parts.  There is a SERVICE and a HANDLE.  The common
way for describing an ACCOUNT will be TOC/Zilding or ICQ/12345678.

CONTACT
  A CONTACT is the representation of a real person, comprised of an identifing
nickname and a collection of ACCOUNTS that the person has. 

HANDLE
  A HANDLE is how a person can be referred to while logged into a SERVICE. 
On AIM, an example of a HANDLE would be 'Zilding'.  On ICQ, an example of a
HANDLE would be 12345678.

SERVICE
  A SERVICE is a protocol and a server.  For example, the AIM SERVICE uses
the TOC protocol (or Oscar...) and the server toc.oscar.aol.com.  The reason
the seperation is made between the protocol and the server is that it is
possible, in the future, that (if there are any open protocols) there may be
several seperate servers with the same protocol, and they will be considered
seperate SERVICEs.
