* Important notes
=================
As of CVS version 0.2.3-107, modules are installed in $prefix/lib/ayttm
instead of $prefix/share/ayttm/modules. It means that the old modules in
$prefix/share/ayttm/modules shouldn't be used anymore because they are not
binary compatible anymore. You _have_ to fix your prefs file to change 
modules paths.
If you get a popup saying

* How to help & be helped
=========================
  - bugreports:
    If you experience a fatal bug (segfault), you can file a bugreport
    on SF.net's bugtracker. The more precise it is, the easier we'll 
    find out how to fix it. In particular, a backtrace is really 
    useful. After a crash you should have a `core' file in your 
    working directory ($HOME if run via a window manager). run gdb with 
    it:
    $ gdb `which ayttm` core
    then at the gdb prompt, type 'bt full':
    (gdb) bt full
    and copy/paste the result to your bugreport.
    You can also easily, automatically get stacktraces by running 
    ./configure --enable-crash-dialog. It'll popup the stack trace every
    time ayttm segfaults.

  - If you experience lots of segfaults after an update (in particular 
    for CVS updates), it is probably caused by a change in a structure
    shared between core and modules. Try a "make clean && make && sudo
    make install" instead of simply "make && sudo make install".
  - If you are a developer and fix a bug or add a feature, we certainly
    want to hear from you :) Please send a patch (ideally, against CVS)
    to SF.net's patchtracker. use `cvs diff -u`.
  - Translations: The existing translations are quite out of date after
    the fork. I plan to update the french one, but that'll be when i'll
    have more time, could be quite long. If you want to submit a 
    translation (or an update to one of the existing), you're very 
    welcome.

* General
=========
  Ayttm is an integrated messenger, which means you can be logged on 
  more than one of the supported services at once. You can then chat
  with people on the services where you have an account. 
  Your "online friends" are grouped by contacts (a contact can have
  more than one account), and by groups (Buddies, etc). You can order
  your contacts by groups by either drag and dropping them, or by 
  editing the contact. You can order your contacts' accounts only by
  editing the account, yet.

I should write more in this README, too...
