This module sends a message via SMTP.  You need to specify your SMTP host
and port in config.

Each contact is an email address, your account is also an email address.
At present the contact password isn't used, but it may be in future if I
support SMTP Auth.

To send a mail, type the entire message in the text area.  To add any
header fields, you must first add the Subject header.

Start your message with Subject: subject.  Put other headers on lines 
after that - one line per header.  The first line that doesn't look like a 
header is your body.  To force the body, leave a blank line between header 
and body.

eg:
1:
This is a simple message



2:
Subject: subject
this is a message with a subject


3:
Subject: subject
From: Philip Tellis
message with other headers


4:
From: philip
simple message.  above line is part of message body


5:
Subject: subject

From: test
blank line forces everything after it to be message body
