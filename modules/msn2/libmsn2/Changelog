		Encapsulated messages in message object

Mon Apr 8:
		Did a lot more on file transfer - wrote API docs for 
		receiving a file, made a decent start on the code to fit 
		them. Nowhere near finished though.

		WARNING - API DOCS AND CODE ARE NOW OUT OF SYNC

Fri Apr 5:

		Fixed a memory leak in msn_handle_MSG ('msg' wasn't freed)
		Started on file transfer.

Thu Apr 4:

		openprojects.net) on the subject of file transfer - 
		generalised (with the aid of some packet dumps from Vance) 
		to voice/video chat, but again, didn't touch the code

Sat Mar 30:

		(Vance Lankhaar, vance@pcsscreston.ca)

Fri Mar 29:

		caused them. API docs updated accordingly.
		Reverse-engineered groups, but didn't touch the code


				------------

		Here the source tree forks. The 1.x tree continues, 
		picking	up bugfixes but remaining the same. The 2.x 
		tree acquires an ambitious TODO (distributed as 
		WHAT_YOU_ARE_MISSING in v1.x).

			THIS IS THE 2.X BRANCH

--- Version 1.2

Thu Mar 14:
		Changed call of ext_new_connection for an answer to an SB 
		session so that it is called BEFORE ext_user_joined.

Wed Mar 13:
		Fixed a segfault (remove-from-llist code didn't set the
		main pointer to NULL when deleting the first item in 
		several places)

--- Version 1.1b

Fri Feb 15:
		Added URL encoding and friendlyname support
		Removed friendlyname information in list add callbacks 
		because it's just the same as the username

		Released as 1.1b


--- Version 1.0b:

Fri Feb 15:
		Added OUT support. Released as 1.0b-r2

--- Alpha stages (no version numbers):


Thu Feb 14:
		Fixed spin when socket closes unexpectedly
		Added functions and callbacks for inviting users and being 
		notified of their arrival/departure from the SB session
		Added API docs for the above
		Added the ability to send typing notifications, and added 
		API docs for the function. Tested msn_send_typing(), then 
		removed the horrible kludge that let me test it, so it's 
		no longer testable from the sample implementation
		*** BETA RELEASE ***


Wed Feb 13:
		Added even more debug output to sample implementation
		Fixed a big fat segfault when closing a connection
		Found that the friendlyname decoding doesn't work
		Capitalised the T in "Content-Type" - can now talk to 
		normal MSN clients
		Added NAK support and a callback, so the program is now 
		notified if a message did not get through to all concerned
		Added the NAK callback to the API docs
		Fixed friendlyname decoding
		Added GTC/BLP modification functions and callbacks, and 
		documented them

Tue Feb 12:
		A ton of new stuff - new callbacks for state changes, new 
		connections, found & fixed another segfault
		Added *lots* of debug output to sample implementation
		Added "proper" way of setting up SB sessions (and made the 
		"ready" indicator work right) - the lib now conforms to 
		its own API docs :^)
		Added decoding for friendly names, can't test without 
		someone else
		API docs now full, accurate, and in sync with the code 
		itself

		I think we can start thinking about integrating now...

Sun Feb 10:
		Basic API docs

		Fixed a segfault when a buddy goes offline
		(Martin Stevens, budgester@budge.net)

Tue Feb 05:	FIRST ALPHA RELEASE (whoopeee!)
		Added callbacks and commands for list synchronisation and 
		management (adding and deleting contacts). Things still
		have to be done manually. Updated commands reference to 
		tell people how to do this. Made a start on the API docs.

Thu Jan 22:	Fixed order of #includes in msn_interface.C
		(Martin Stevens, budgester@budge.net)

Thu Jan 22:	Started Changelog
