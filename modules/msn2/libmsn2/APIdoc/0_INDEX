	This is the API documentation for Meredydd Luff's MSN 
library, version 2.x. Feel free to email me (m_luff@wincoll.ac.uk)
or message me (blip109 on AOL, blip109@hotmail.com on MSN (not email), 
modula7 on Yahoo) if you find any inaccuracy or are having a problem.

	These docs are divided into several sections:

(1)	A quick "user's guide" to the MSN protocol - just enough general 
	knowledge to allow you to understand the rest of these docs.

(2)	Basic architecture of the library

(3)	Miscellaneous things to implement

(4)	Connections to the MSN servers, email notification and managing 
	FriendlyNames

(5)	Changing state and privacy settings

(6)	Sending and receiving instant messages

(7)	Managing the lists on the server

(8)	File transfer


  (here the manuscript breaks off into indecipherable spidery handwriting. 
	The last few words visible are, "Use the Source, Luke...")
