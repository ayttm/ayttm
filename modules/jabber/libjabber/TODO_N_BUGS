Known bugs:
-  Sometimes users go offline, and their status changes to offline, but they don't appear to go offline.
-  No support for group chat:
	It's a module on the server.  Should be there soon...
-  Deleting contacts works manually, but when notified that another
	user has unsubscribed you, the display does not update to reflect
	that the user has been deleted when you agree to delete them.
-  Contacts are not added based upon local file
-  When moving a user from one group to another, the user is sent an
	unsubscribe followed by a subscribe request.
-  Unlogged-in accounts still show online

TODOs:
-  Make debugging depend upon command-line flag or env var.
-  Reconnect to the server on a disconnect.
