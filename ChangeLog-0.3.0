Ayttm 0.3.0 has been released.
The minor version number bump is there because we feel there are
enough new features since 0.2.0 to motivate it, and to help people
read the release notes because things changed and we'll get bugreports 
if no-one reads it.
Modules path has changed, it is now $PREFIX/lib/ayttm instead of 
$PREFIX/share/ayttm/modules. So if upgrading, you have to change your 
~/.ayttm/prefs file by replacing "share/ayttm/modules" by "lib/ayttm".
Provided on sourceforge is a perlscript that does the job.
