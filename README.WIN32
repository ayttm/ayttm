In order to compile AYTTM on WIN32 platforms you must first install cygwin
and its development environment as we will be using the MINGW32 portion 
of it. In addition you will need to get the runtime and development
GTK and GLIB archives from http://www.gimp.org/win32. You want the version
1.2 of GTK not the 2.0. Unzip these into the /target directory when using
a cygwin shell.

To Generate the program for WIN32 runtime once you have cygwin installed

	./mingw
