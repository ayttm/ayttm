HOWTO translate Yattm ?

* if you want to make a translation in a new langage
	* get any .po file in this directory
	* rename it to LL.po, where LL is your language code
	* update the translations ;-)
	* send your file to ayttm-users@nongnu.org
	  or, if you have cvs write access, add it, plus:
	  - add your language code to ALL_LINGUAS in configure.in

* if you want to update a translation (and as long as you don't update the .po file manually)
	* as xgettext isn't nice, you'll have to
	* replace every _() by gettext() in the C files
	* go to ayttm main folder and type
	  xgettext [path/to/files/file.C] 
	* it'll give you a messages.po you can concatenate to the 
	  existing .po
	* replace every gettext() by _() in the source files (for
	  the sake of readability ;-)

Thanks :-)
